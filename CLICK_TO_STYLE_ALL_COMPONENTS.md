# Click-to-Style All Components Feature

## Overview
Extended the click-to-style functionality to make ALL resume components editable, not just section headings. Users can now click on any element (text, containers, dividers, items) to style them, and delete removable elements. The style panel is integrated into the left sidebar for a seamless editing experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. StylePanel.js - Extended Style Options
Added style options for all component types:
- **Name**: Size, color, font
- **Title**: Size, color, font
- **Section Titles**: Size, color, weight, transform
- **Dividers**: Color, style (solid/dashed/dotted/double), thickness
- **Summary Text**: Size, color, line height
- **Contact Info**: Size, color
- **Experience/Education/Project Items**: Text size, color, title weight
- **Skills List**: Size, color
- **Section Containers**: Spacing, background color

### 2. ClassicTemplate/index.js - Made All Components Clickable
Updated all sections to be clickable and styleable:

#### Header Components
- Name (h1)
- Title (h2)
- Contact info container

#### Section Components
- Section containers (with background styling)
- Section titles
- Dividers
- Summary text
- Experience items (with delete)
- Education items (with delete)
- Project items (with delete)
- Skills list
- Languages list
- Links items (with delete)
- Custom sections (with delete)
- Custom subheadings (with delete)

### 3. editor.js - Delete Functionality
Added `handleDeleteElement` function that handles deletion of:
- Experience items
- Education items
- Project items
- Links items
- Custom sections
- Custom subheadings

### 4. CSS Styling
Added visual feedback for clickable elements:
- Hover state: Dashed outline with light background
- Selected state: Solid outline with highlighted background
- Smooth transitions for better UX

## How It Works

### Clicking Components
1. User clicks any component in the resume
2. Component info (type, index, section, etc.) is passed to `handleComponentClick`
3. Sidebar automatically switches to the "Style" tab
4. Component-specific styling options appear in the sidebar
5. User can adjust styling options specific to that component type

### Deleting Elements
1. Deletable elements show a delete button in the style panel
2. Clicking delete removes the element from the resume
3. Works for: experience, education, projects, links, custom sections, and subheadings

### Component Info Structure
```javascript
{
  type: 'componentType',        // e.g., 'experienceItem', 'divider', 'sectionTitle'
  index: 0,                     // For array items
  section: 'sectionName',       // e.g., 'experience', 'education'
  sectionId: 'customId',        // For custom sections
  subheadingId: 'subId',        // For custom subheadings
  deletable: true               // Whether element can be deleted
}
```

## Styling Options by Component

- Size (range slider)
- Color (color picker)

## Technical Details

### Component Detection
- Uses event propagation with `stopPropagation()`
- Nested elements can be clicked independently
- Parent containers don't interfere with child clicks

### State Management
- Selected component stored in React state
- Active section automatically switches to 'style'
- Sidebar shows on mobile when component is clicked
- Component info includes type, index, section, and deletable flag

### Styling Application
- Inline styles applied directly to elements
- Styling values stored in `resumeData.styling`
- Defaults provided for all properties
- Changes persist across template switches
